# Mandli_Takehome
Takehome project for Mandli Communications

Project includes two classes contained in 

- RangeContainer.java: Class that defines a TreeSet based container class that stores and manages while numbers by range.
- Range.java: Class that defines a single range on whole numbers.

Project now also includes a manager file for demonstrating the program, launch via 'java Manager'
- I've also included a gif of the manager demonstrating scaling and merging of ranges.

Both files contain javadoc comments which should detail usage.
